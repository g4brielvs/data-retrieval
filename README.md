# Mobility Data Retrieval

## Taxonomy

Taxonomy represents the formal structure of classes or types of objects within the domain of IT4 Big Data Lab information processing.

For the purpose of the data validation and data cleansing, we kept track of the taxonomy on a temporary JSON file.

All routines related to taxonomy are stored at `src/taxonomy.py`
